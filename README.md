In today’s world, where surveillance is becoming increasingly widespread, privacy is more important than ever. We believe that every individual has the fundamental right to private communication—and that no government or authority should be allowed to monitor personal conversations. That’s why our encryption and messaging system is designed to protect against exactly that.

Unlike conventional messaging platforms that rely on centralized servers, Cryptix will operate entirely on a decentralized blockchain architecture. This means there is no single point of failure—no central authority to shut it down, intercept it, or manipulate it.

@V.1.1
- Quantum Security Explanation
This encryption scheme leverages the SHA-256 midstate — the internal hash state after half of the compression rounds — as a secret, fixed “password” derived from the conversation_id. By combining this midstate with a random nonce and a message_id, the key derivation function creates a large, high-entropy key space.
Traditional PoW systems or symmetric keys typically rely on 32- or 64-bit nonces, limiting the search space. Here, the effective search space expands to roughly 2^160 due to the 128-bit midstate entropy plus the 32-bit nonce.
Against quantum attacks using Grover’s algorithm (which offers a quadratic speedup), the complexity becomes approximately 2^80 operations — far beyond the reach of foreseeable quantum computers.
Thus, the design inherently increases resistance to quantum brute-force attacks without sacrificing performance or requiring new cryptographic primitives, making your implementation effectively quantum-resistant.
